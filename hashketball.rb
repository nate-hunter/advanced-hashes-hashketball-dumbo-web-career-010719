# So, we have a hash with our data. The top-level keys are :home and :away - we want to be able to find data for both teams by simply passing an argument of a player's name into the method. First, the :home and :away teams have to be accessible. To do that, they can be merged into a method with .merge, which will accept the keys of :players and its values for both the :home and :away teams. The method can be used to access player data. Next we go into this merged hash and .fetch the player's name, to get :points, :shoe, and stats. A similar strategy could be used to get both team's values into one method, which could be used for team_names, player_numbers,

  game_hash[:home][:players].merge(game_hash[:away][:players])
